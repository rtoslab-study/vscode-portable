# vscode-portable
This is a VSCode portable version based on github action. You can get latest version of VSCode with your favorite extensions defined in 'extensions.txt'.

My extensions list as below:

1. ahmadawais.shades-of-purple
2. eamodio.gitlens
3. MS-CEINTL.vscode-language-pack-zh-hans
4. ms-vscode.cpptools
5. vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons
6. continue.continue

How to get extensions list?

Windows:

```
cd cd %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
dir
```
